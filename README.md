# A quick setting for vimrc and bashrc.

### Usage:
    $ git clone https://github.com/chen0423/workingEnv.git
    $ cd workingEnv
    $ vim vimrc (change Plugin and other setting to what you want)
    $ ./install.sh

### Note:
    The colorscheme used in this vimrc is "blues"
But it may not work very well in some language(e.g. c++), since it have no different color on string and number in c++.
Therefore, maybe you will need to change such setting by typing
    : colorscheme  [another colorscheme name]
Typing above line in vim(cmd mode)

### vimrc base on:
* Vundle
